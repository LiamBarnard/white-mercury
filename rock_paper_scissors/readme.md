## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Functions** Module. It was created to learn about JavaScript function syntax, passing data to functions, the return keyword, ES6 arrow functions, and concise body syntax.

### Project Goals

**Context:** Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

- Rock destroys scissors.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Paper covers rock.
- If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

Our code will break the game into four parts:
1. Get the user’s choice.
2. Get the computer’s choice.
3. Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
4. Start the program and display the results."

### Tasks

1. Create a variable to get the user's choice, using the function `.toLowerCase()` to ensure any variant of the selection is the same
2. Use `Math.random` in conjunction with a `switch` statement to get the computer's choice
3. Create a `determineWinner` function, utilising a variety of `if` statements to determine the winner of the game
4. Create a `const` variable to combine all of the created functions and output the winner and choices to the console

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
