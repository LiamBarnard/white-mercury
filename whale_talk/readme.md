## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Loops** Module. It was created to learn how to use for and while loops to execute blocks of code multiple times.

### Project Goals

**Context:** Aake a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.

### Tasks

1. Create a variable for the input, an array containing only vowels, and a result array to store the output of the function
2. Create a loop to iterate through each letter of the input variable
3. Use a for loop to iterate through the vowels array, comparing this against the input, return the output to the result array
4. Whales double their ee's and their u's. Use an `if` statement to check this and the array function `.push` to add this
5. Log the output array to the console using `.join` to make it one big word!

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Using a for loop to iterate though an array
- Built upon array knowledge and array functions

## Useful resources 

- [MDN Web Docs | For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) - Documentation for For.
