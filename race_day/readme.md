## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Conditionals** Module. It was created to learn how to use if, else if, else, switch, and ternary syntax to control the flow of a program in JavaScript.


### Project Goals

**Context:** Codecademy’s annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.

As a timeline, registration would look like this: registration-timeline

Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

- Race number:
Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.

- Start time:
Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

### Tasks

1. Create a variable named raceNumber to calculate the runners number
2. Create 2 `const` variables for `earlyRunner` and `runnerAge`
3. If the runner is an early runner and under 18 years old, add 1000 to race number in a function
4. Calculate if the runner is early, and their age and assign a number based off the calculations. Point 3 adds 1000 automatically for us
5. This method doesn't account for runners who are exactly 18
6. Create a variable specifically for the runners who are 18

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Conditionals
- Building upon `if/else` knowledge

## Useful resources
