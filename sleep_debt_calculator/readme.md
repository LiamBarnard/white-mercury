## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Functions** Module. It was created to learn about JavaScript function syntax, passing data to functions, the return keyword, ES6 arrow functions, and concise body syntax.

### Project Goals

**Context:** Did you know that giraffes sleep 4.6 hours a day? We humans need more than that. If we don’t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. In this project we’ll calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.

The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.

Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly sleep goal.

### Tasks

1. Create a variable to store the sleep hours for the week, using  `if...else` statements to get the hours for each day
2. Use another variable to return the sleep hours from the previous variable
3. Create a `getIdealSleepHours` variable, to calculate 8 (ideal sleep hours) * 7 (days)
4. Create a `const` variable to retrieve the total hours slept, compare it with the ideal sleep hours and return a statement based on whether enough sleep has been had!

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Stronger understanding of using `if...else` statements

## Useful resources 

- [MDN Web Docs |  if...else statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) - Documentation for the `if...else` statement.
