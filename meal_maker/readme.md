## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Objects** Module. It was created to learn about JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items.

### Project Goals

**Context:** A restaurant has hired you to create a function for their website that allows them to set a meal and price each morning for Today’s Special. Use your knowledge of getters and setters to make sure anyone who uses the new function can generate a meal and a price for Today’s Special without any embarrassing errors!

### Tasks

1. Create a variable under `const` to hold the menu, with key-value pairs in for the `_meal` and `_price`.
2. Add 2 setters fpr setting the `meal` and `price`
3. Use a getter in the `menu` to retrieve the information and return a template literal
4. Using `menu.meal` and `menu.price` the variable can be updated to today's menu thanks to the setters
5. Log `menu.getter` to retrieve the daily special
