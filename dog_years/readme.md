## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Introduction** Module. It was created to build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals by practicing initializing variables and printing to the console.


### Project Goals

**Context:** Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

### Tasks

1. Create a variable named `myAge` and set equal to your age.
2. Create a variable named `earlyYears` that corresponds to the first two years of a dog's life.
3. Create a variable named `laterYears` that corresponds to the remaining years of a dog's life.
4. Add `earlyYears` and `laterYears` together and store in a variable named `myAgeInDogYears`.
5. Print a statement to the console that displays your name and age in dog years.

## My process
