## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Objects** Module. It was created to learn about JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items.

### Project Goals

**Context:** Building an app to track team stats across games from any sport or team. I, of course, chose Manchester United! (I can't promise the game data is correct, although I very much hope it is)

### Tasks

1. Declare a `const` variable called `team`
2. Add 2 properties to the team, `_players` and `_games`
3. Add some players and games with relevant properties (Name, Age, Opponent, Goals)
4. Create getter methods for `players` and `game` to retrieve the information from the variable
5. Create new `.addPlayer` and `.addGame` methods to add to the current data

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Objects and key-value pairs
- Using getters and setters
