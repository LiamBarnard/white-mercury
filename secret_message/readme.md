## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Arrays** Module. It was created to learn about arrays, a data structure in JavaScript used to store lists of data.

### Project Goals

**Context:** I can't tell you... it's a secret!

### Tasks

1. Using JavaScript array methods to move the given array of strings about and change it
2. Log the result to the console, to see results

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Array methods and how to use them such as `.pop` and `.push`
- Arrays and how to manipulate them
- Creating functions to utilise array methods to be recalled as part of a program

## Useful resources
