## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Conditionals** Module. It was created to learn how to use if, else if, else, switch, and ternary syntax to control the flow of a program in JavaScript.


### Project Goals

**Context:** We need a way to decide fate, and apparently 34 lines of JavaScript code was the solution.

In this project I built a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.

The user will be able to input a question, then the program will output a random fortune.

### Tasks

1. Create a variable named userName that the user can leave empty or set to their name.
2. Create a ternary expression that decides what to do if the user enters a name or not.
3. Create a variable named userQuestion. The value of the variable should be a string that is the question the user wants to ask the Magic Eight Ball.
4. Write a console.log() statement for the userQuestion, stating what was asked.
5. Create a variable named randomNumber that generates a number between 0 and 7.
6. Create a variable named eightBall that takes in the value of randomNumber and assigns one of the eight possible Magic Eight Ball phrases as its reply.
7. Print the Magic Eight Ball's reply to the console.

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Conditionals
- Using `switch` instead of `if/else` statements
- Combining `Math.floor` and `Math.random()` to generate a random number
