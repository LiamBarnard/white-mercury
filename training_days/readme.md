## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Scope** Module. It was created to learn about global and block level scope in JavaScript.

### Project Goals

**Context:** As a seasoned athlete, one of your favorite activities is running marathons. You use a service called Training Days that sends you a message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to train.

Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less error-prone by fixing variable scopes.

### Tasks

1. "`let` name = " to get the users name at the start of the program
2. Use `Math.floor` and `Math.random` to generate a random number between 1-3 and align Marathon, Triathlon, or Pentathlon to each of these
3. Work out the training days required for each event, using `if...else` to return 50 days training for a Marathon, 100 days for a Triathlon, and 200 days for a Pentathlon
4. Create 2 variables to log the event and time to train based on the above calculations

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Scope, and how having the scope of something too loose, or too tight can affect the functionality of a JavaScript program
- How to recognise Scope errors and fix them

## Useful resources 

- [MDN Web Docs | Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) - Documentation for Scope.
