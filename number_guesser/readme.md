## Overview

### About

This project is part of the **JavaScript Syntax: Part I** Module. It was created to get an introduction to JavaScript and get comfortable with the basics of writing JavaScript programs.

### Project Goals

**Context:** As the market was missing a good, competitive number guessing game against a challenging AI, I got tasked to create just that. The rules are simple, pick a number, get closer to the randomly generated target number than the randomly generated computer guess and you win! 

### Tasks

1. Work in script.js to work with the game.js
2. Create 3 `let` variables to contain the scores of each player and the round number
3. Use `Math.floor` and `Math.random` to generate a random number between 0 and 10, store this in a const variable
4. Use the random number for the target score and computer score
5. Compare the results against the target score, using `Math.abs` to calculate the biggest difference as the loser
6. Update the score of the winning user and the round number

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Combined prior knowledge from the module of conditionals, fucntions, and scope to complete this project
